2016,School of Applied Science,Diploma in Applied Food Science & Nutrition,T26,A0A,"What’s in your favourite snack of crisps or instant noodles? Why do food manufacturers add chemicals to our packaged food? Can food really help us feel and look good? More and more, the world has become concerned with the nutritional value of our food. We see it in our friends who refuse to eat chicken skin or dessert toppings and fillings laced with cream; we also see it in those who opt for a “low carbo” diet and those who label fast-food and dessert as “sin”.Are the tastiest foods also the “unhealthiest”? What makes the “healthy” so beneficial for us? And why do we all have friends who can eat all they want and apparently never put on weight?This Diploma course explores these issues and more, as students learn to become food science and nutrition professionals. They will discover the science behind food and how its components react with each other and/or impact our health. Students will learn how to develop innovative, healthier and safer foods as well as evaluate meals, and how to manage diseases using diet and food. Applying the scientific knowledge of both food science and nutrition, students will get a headstart in the food, nutrition and healthcare industries!",http://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/asc/applied-food-science-and-nutrition
